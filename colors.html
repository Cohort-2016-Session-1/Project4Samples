        //Step 1: Create an array of HTML colors
        var colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow", "white", "black", "purple", "orange", "brown", "grey"];

        //Step 2: Use a random number generator to pick one of the above colors.
        //Hint: This will generate a random number between 0 and 9:
        //i = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10));
        //Select the i-th element from the array in Step 1--this is the "Computer choice"

        //Step 3: Prompt the user for a color choice (i.e. like in the assignment document

        //Step 4: Compare the "User choice" in Step 3 to the "Computer choice" from Step 2

        //Step 5: Create an IF statement:
            //The user might have entered a color that doesn't exist in the array
            //"User choice" is alphabetically < "Computer choice"
            //"User choice" is alphabetically > "Computer choice"
            //"User choice" == "Computer choice"

        //Step 6: Alert the user of success or failure.  Change background color IF success.
